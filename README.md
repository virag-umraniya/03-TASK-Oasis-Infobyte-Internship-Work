# 03-TASK-Oasis-Infobyte-Internship-Work
Car Price Prediction This project uses machine learning to predict car prices based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and engine size. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were applied. Performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R².

# Car Price Prediction - Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed during my Data Science internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The objective was to build a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and engine size.

## 🏢 About Oasis Infobyte
Oasis Infobyte is a leading tech company offering internship opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development, and more. They focus on practical learning and skill development in real-world projects, helping students prepare for the industry.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a car using its features, enabling car dealerships and buyers to have an estimated price for the vehicle.

### Features used for prediction:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Engine Size
- Other relevant features

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**.  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed visualizations and analyzed the relationships between features using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Applied various machine learning algorithms, including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forest**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R² score** to ensure accurate price predictions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Outcome
The project successfully predicted car prices with a high degree of accuracy. The Random Forest model provided the best performance, with minimal error.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was collected from an online source that included various car features. It was used to train and test the models.

## 🙌 Acknowledgment
Thanks to **Oasis Infobyte** for providing the opportunity to work on this real-world project and for their guidance throughout the internship.
